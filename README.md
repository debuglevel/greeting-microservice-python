# Python Microservice Template
Python microservice template, inspired by my Kotlin based microservice template https://github.com/debuglevel/greeting-microservice, but with way less enthusiasm.

## Development environment
* PyCharm Community
* venv
* Python 3.8

## TODO
* Dockerfile
* .dockerignore  
* requirements.txt
* dev cheat sheet
* basic Flask stuff
* maybe even OpenAPI
* Logging that does not completely suck
